This project makes scheduling employees more efficient. As a lifeguard, my manager spends a lot of time gathering everyoneâ€™s availability
and creating a schedule that matches the availabilities and desired hours of employees. After gathering employee information, the manager
can input their name, availability, and desired hours into the employee_data spreadsheet and the scheduler program will create an optimal schedule. 
This will be displayed in the program's terminal and a separate schedule spreadsheet. This project is made specifically for the company I work at, ultizling 
their hours of operation and shifts. I stil have aspects I want to improve like utilizing shifts as constraints and combining the outputed schedule to be
more concise by combining like days.
